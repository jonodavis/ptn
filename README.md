Need to read the news but stuck out in the bush with only one bar of 3G? Only have a few kilobytes of precious cellular data left and really need to read the news? You'll love ptn! ❤️

ptn (plain text news) is the service which runs [news.pancake.nz](https://news.pancake.nz). The goal of ptn is to provide an up to date index of news headlines as efficiently as possible.
